# Cathode-Ray-Tube-CRT-Experiment
A physics and electronics experiment based on cathode ray tube technology.  How it works: An electron beam travels inside a vacuum tube and is deflected using electric or magnetic fields. This demonstrates fundamental principles of electromagnetism and early display technology.
